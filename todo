TODO List:

1) Fix messages so that we read in all of a message into another buffer so that we can process
    messages properly -- right now I am potentially dropping messages when there are more
    complete messages waiting to be processed after the first message I see. 

    - Use a loop and read a single character at a time. 
    - Search for:
      + max length of message, or
      + closing delimeter

2) Implement a timer so that the game will start once the timer has timed out. The timer should just use the
    timeout value on our call to "select" in the main loop in the "run" method.

3) When establishing connections, create a "player" object for the game. 

4)
