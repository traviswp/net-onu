                                              TODO List:
===============================================================================================================

- Server: change the way messages are written. Buffer outgoing messages into a list of descriptors so that
          the call to select doesn't hang during auto play

- Server: Implement a strike system for players that are playing (5 strikes and boot?).

- Client: AI (still needs some work...)

- Server: error handling - server should NOT raise exceptions due to client

- Server: add "waiting"

                                              Complete:
===============================================================================================================

- Server: Implement a timer for players that are playing - if they don't respond with a valid play 
          (30 seconds or so) then drop that player from the game.

- Server/Client: Fix messages so that we read in all of a message into another buffer so that we can process
                 messages properly -- right now I am potentially dropping messages when there are more
                 complete messages waiting to be processed after the first message I see. 
            
                 - Use a loop and read a single character at a time. 
                 - Search for:
                   + max length of message, or
                   + closing delimeter

- Server/Client: clean up output

- Client: add ability to connect via IP address or web address
    - e.g. 127.0.0.1 or cf405-20.cs.wwu.edu
