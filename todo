TODO List:

2) Implement a timer for players that are playing - if they don't respond with a valid play (30 seconds or so) then
drop that player from the game.

3) AI

4) clean up server/client output

5) error handling - server should NOT raise exceptions due to client

6) add "waiting"

Complete:

x 1)Fix messages so that we read in all of a message into another buffer so that we can process
    messages properly -- right now I am potentially dropping messages when there are more
    complete messages waiting to be processed after the first message I see. 

    - Use a loop and read a single character at a time. 
    - Search for:
      + max length of message, or
      + closing delimeter


x 7) add ability to connect via IP address or web address
    - e.g. 127.0.0.1 or cf405-20.cs.wwu.edu
