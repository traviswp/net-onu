net-uno
  The program that lives here is a networked implementation of
  the "popular" game UNO. Feel free to use code if it is useful, 
  but do the right thing and cite it. 

  The two main components are:
    server
    client

  This is my attempt at implementing my first GUI for the game
  as well, while learning about some networking concepts in my
  final quarter at Western.

  More details can be found at a later time in soon-to-be
  written supporting documentation. 

  Enjoy!
