    # This message is sent to a client from the server telling the client 
    # that they have been accepted into the game. The name coming back from 
    # the server may be different if the name the client sent with the join 
    # command was already taken. If this happens, a number will be appended 
    # to the end of the client's nickname.

    ACCEPT    = "[accept|RETURN_NAME]"

    #
    # This message is sent to a client when it is getting dealt cards. 
    # This command will work when any number of cards is being dealt to a client.
    # The number being dealt will be as follows:
    #    -Initial deal: 7 cards will be dealt
    #    -Unable to play: 1 card will be dealt
    #    -Draw 2 is played by previous player: 2 cards will be dealt
    #    -Wild draw 4 card is played by previous player: 4 cards will be dealt
    #
    # The format of the cards in the message will be the first letter of the 
    # color (for example: R for red), followed by the number or character 
    # representing the type of card. If the card is a draw 2 card, the second 
    # character will be a D. If the card is a skip card, the character will be 
    # an S. If the card is a wild card, the characters will be NW, the N 
    # signifying that it doesnâ€™t have a color. This will be changed to a color 
    # when it is played. If the card is a wild draw 4 card, the characters will 
    # be NF. The same rule about the second character of the wild card applies 
    # to the wild draw 4 card as well.
    #
    # A few examples of cards: a red 4 is R4, a green draw 2 is GD, 
    # a yellow skip is YS, a blue reverse is BU, a wild card is NW, 
    #a wild draw 4 card is NF, etc.

    #
    # This message is sent to the client from the server telling the client 
    # that it is that client's turn. The card is the top card on the discard 
    # pile. The format of how the card will be look follows how the cards 
    # command formats the cards except if the card is a wild card, a color 
    # will be specified. So, for example, if the player that played the wild 
    # card specified the color to be yellow, the card would show up as YW. 
    # This is true for wild draw 4 cards as well, so if a player decided to 
    # chose red as their color, it would show up as RF.

    # This message is sent to the client that just tried to play an invalid

    # circumstances, for instance the player tried to play a green 7 on a 
    # yellow 5, or if the player tried to play a card that the player didn't 
    # have. The message field will tell the player why their play was an 
    # invalid play.
