            # The number being dealt will be as follows:

            #    -Unable to play: 1 card will be dealt

            # representing the type of card. If the card is a draw 2 card, the second 
            # character will be a D. If the card is a skip card, the character will be 
            # an S. If the card is a wild card, the characters will be NW, the N
